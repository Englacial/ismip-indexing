Users should cite the original publication when using all or part of the data. 
In order to document CMIP6’s scientific impact and enable ongoing support of CMIP, users are also obligated to acknowledge CMIP6, ISMIP6 and the participating modeling groups.

About the dataset:

- The results are based on model output computed from the ISMIP6 native grids that vary between models. 
- The results are calculated over the ice-covered area of Antarctica, corrected for map projection errors, ice sheet model specific densities taken into account.
- Results for the experiments 'exp*' are provided both as raw results and calculated as differences to the control experiment (ctrl_proj_open or ctrl_proj_std depending on the experiment). The later files are named with "minus_ctrl_proj" to indicate that the control run is substracted.
- Results for ctrl_proj_open, ctrl_proj_std, hist_open and hist_std are not corrected to remove the control run.
